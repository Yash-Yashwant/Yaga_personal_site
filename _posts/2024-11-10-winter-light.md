Winter brings a unique quality of light - low, soft, and ethereal. The sun hangs closer to the horizon, stretching shadows and bathing everything in warm tones even at midday.

## The Golden Hour Extends

In winter, golden hour isn't just an hour. The sun takes its time crossing the sky, giving photographers an extended window of beautiful, directional light.

I've been out every clear morning this week, camera in hand, watching how the light transforms familiar streets into something magical.

## Embracing the Cold

Photography in winter requires dedication. Numb fingers struggle with camera dials. Breath fogs lenses. But the images captured in these conditions carry the feeling of that crisp, cold air.

There's honesty in winter photography - no lush greens to hide behind, no easy subjects. Just light, shadow, and composition.

## What I've Learned

- Dress in layers (obvious but essential)
- Keep spare batteries warm in your pocket
- Embrace minimalism in composition
- Let the light be your subject

More winter photographs coming soon. Follow along as the season unfolds.
