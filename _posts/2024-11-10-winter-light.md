I was not someone who liked hiking in general, not until I moved to Colorado and met the people around me. If it were just me alone, tucked away in my apartment, I would probably just stare at my monitor and type, type, type. But I realized that the people around you have a major influence on how you behave subconsciously, and that is what got me out on early morning hikes. My friends had a huge impact in this regard.

## What I've Learned

- Actively tracking time boosts productivity 
- It is really important to network with people
- Embracing the small things matter
- My songs taste has changed; as I have grown older, I have moved more toward melody based songs over hip hop and rap, rap


More photos coming...

Until next time, keep your eyes open for the extraordinary in the ordinary.
