There's something magical about autumn in the city. The light changes, casting long golden shadows across old buildings. The air grows crisp, and every walk becomes an opportunity to observe the changing season.

## Finding Beauty in the Everyday

I've been taking my camera on daily walks, looking for those fleeting moments that make you stop and appreciate the present. A leaf caught in perfect light. Steam rising from a coffee shop window. The warm glow of streetlights at dusk.

Photography teaches patience. Sometimes you have to wait for the right moment, the right light, the right composition. But when it all comes together, there's a deep satisfaction in capturing that instant.

## Technical Notes

For these autumn shots, I've been shooting with:
- **Camera**: Classic film camera (because vintage themes extend to photography!)
- **Film**: Kodak Portra 400 for warm, nostalgic tones
- **Time**: Golden hour, naturally

The analog process forces me to be more intentional with each shot. No spray-and-pray here - just careful composition and thoughtful exposure.

## Sharing the Journey

I'll be posting more photography here regularly. Each image tells a story, and I hope they resonate with you as much as they do with me.

Until next time, keep your eyes open for the extraordinary in the ordinary.
