## Journey

I moved to Boulder last year. Such a beautiful place, with amazing people. We’re so lucky to have good friends, and I made a few. This photo is dedicated to them, for taking me all around Boulder and giving me a tour of Colorado. They don’t live in Boulder anymore, it sure feels different.

## Sharing the Journey

I'll be posting more photography here regularly. Each image tells a story, and I hope they resonate with you as much as they do with me. 

Until next time, keep your eyes open for the extraordinary in the ordinary.
