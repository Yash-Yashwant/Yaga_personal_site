Welcome to my personal website! This is where I'll be sharing my thoughts, projects, and photography.

## What You'll Find Here

I'll be writing about:

- **Technology**: My experiences with different programming languages and tools
- **Projects**: Deep dives into things I'm building
- **Photography**: Visual stories from my travels and daily life
- **Life**: Random musings and lessons learned

## The Journey

Building this site has been an interesting journey. I wanted something simple, elegant, and easy to maintain - just write in markdown and publish. The vintage aesthetic feels timeless, much like the written word itself.

Stay tuned for more posts!
