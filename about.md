# About Me

<div class="intro" style="margin: 2rem 0;">
    <p>Writer. Developer. Photographer. Eternal student of craft.</p>
</div>

## What I Do

I build things with code, capture moments with cameras, and tell stories with words. This site is where all three intersect.

### Development

By day, I write software. I'm passionate about clean code, elegant solutions, and tools that get out of your way. My projects range from machine learning experiments to command-line utilities - whatever solves a problem or teaches me something new.

### Photography

There's magic in freezing a moment. I shoot primarily film, embracing the deliberate, thoughtful process it demands. You'll find my photographic work scattered throughout this site, especially in posts tagged with "photos."

### Writing

Writing clarifies thinking. I write about technology, creative process, and the lessons learned along the way. Sometimes technical, sometimes philosophical, always genuine.

## This Site

Built with Jekyll because I believe in the power of plain text. The vintage aesthetic isn't just design - it's a reminder that good writing, solid code, and compelling images are timeless.

Everything here is written in markdown, versioned with Git, and published as simple HTML. No databases, no complexity, just content.
