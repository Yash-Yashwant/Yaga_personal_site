A minimalist, keyboard-driven note-taking application built for speed and simplicity.

## The Problem

Most note-taking apps are bloated with features you never use. I wanted something fast, simple, and markdown-native.

## The Solution

A web app that:
- Opens instantly
- Saves automatically
- Uses markdown for formatting
- Works offline
- Syncs across devices

## Features

### Speed First
- Loads in under 100ms
- Instant search across all notes
- Keyboard shortcuts for everything
- No loading spinners, ever

### Privacy Focused
- All data encrypted
- Self-hostable
- No tracking or analytics
- Your notes, your server

### Developer Friendly
- Full markdown support
- Syntax highlighting for code
- Export to multiple formats
- Git integration for backups

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript
- **Storage**: IndexedDB for local, optional sync server
- **Editor**: Custom markdown editor built on CodeMirror
- **Sync**: WebSocket-based real-time sync

## Lessons Learned

Building this taught me about:
- Performance optimization at every level
- Progressive web app architecture
- Conflict resolution in distributed systems
- The importance of keyboard-driven UX

## Try It

The app is open source and free to use. Check out the demo or host it yourself!
