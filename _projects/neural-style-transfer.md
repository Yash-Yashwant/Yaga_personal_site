A deep learning project that applies artistic styles to photographs using convolutional neural networks.

## Overview

This project implements neural style transfer, allowing you to transform any photograph into an artistic masterpiece by applying the style of famous paintings.

## How It Works

The algorithm uses a pre-trained VGG network to:
1. Extract content features from your photo
2. Extract style features from an artwork
3. Combine them to create a new, stylized image

## Example Results

Input a photo of a city street, apply Van Gogh's "Starry Night" style, and get a dreamy, swirling interpretation of modern architecture.

## Technical Stack

- **Framework**: TensorFlow/Keras
- **Model**: VGG19 for feature extraction
- **Optimization**: L-BFGS for image generation
- **Interface**: Streamlit for easy experimentation

## What I Learned

This project taught me about:
- Convolutional neural networks and feature extraction
- Optimization techniques for image generation
- The mathematics behind artistic style
- Building user-friendly interfaces for ML models

## Future Enhancements

- Real-time video style transfer
- Custom style training
- Mobile app deployment
- Multi-style blending
